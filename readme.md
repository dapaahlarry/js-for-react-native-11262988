### Overview

This repository contains solutions to a series of tasks involving JavaScript functions for manipulating arrays and creating user profiles. Below is a brief explanation of each task and the corresponding implementation.

### Task 1: Array Manipulation

- **Description:** The `processArray` function takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array. In this new array, each even number is squared, and each odd number is tripled.

### Task 2: Formatting Array Strings

- **Description:** The `formatArrayStrings` function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizes the entire string if the number is even, and converts the string to lowercase if the number is odd.


### Task 3: Creating User Profiles

- **Description:** The `createUserProfiles` function takes an array of original names and an array of modified names from Task 2. It returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and an `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
